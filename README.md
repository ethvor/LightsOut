Ethan Voraritskul - LightsOut

ps, i dont know how to write markdown files.

key features in the app:
-cell state is boolean, and is either true or false. True represents on, and False represents off.
-cells/cell states are stored in an array representing a 3 by 3 grid.

green boxes:
pg 3:
    -cellState matrix - private boolean cellState [][]; (line 17)
    -recolor() function (defined on line 118)
    -grid = findViewById(...) (on 92, not sure about this one.)

pg 7:
    -google is your friend, and told me about "android:onClick" attributes. this would achieve the same functionality without an onClickListener.

pg9:
    layout name: "activity_win.xml"
